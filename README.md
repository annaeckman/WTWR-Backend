# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR(what to wear) application. MongDB is used to create a database while a REST API is set up to create, read, update, and delete information on the server. Node.js and Express are used to develop the server within a Javascript framework. The server is set up with security and testing through postman which is deployable to web applications. Users can register, update their account info and sign in and out, all while the server and user info is secure.
